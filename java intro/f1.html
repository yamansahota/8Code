    <h1>What is Java ? </h1>
    <p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few
        implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let
        programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA). meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that
        support Java without the need to recompile Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on
        any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar
        to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic
        capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional
        compiled languages.</p>

    <h1>History Of Java</h1>
    <p>James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991. Java was
        originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced for the digital cable television
        industry at the time. The language was initially called Oak after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling's
        office. Later the project went by the name Green and was finally renamed Java, from Java coffee, a type of
        coffee from Indonesia. Gosling designed Java with a C/C++ - style syntax that system and application programmers
        would find familiar.</p>
    <p>Sun Microsystems released the first public implementation as Java 1.0 in 1996.[25] It promised write once, run
        anywhere (WORA) functionality, providing no-cost run-times on popular platforms. Fairly secure and featuring
        configurable security, it allowed network- and file-access restrictions. Major web browsers soon incorporated
        the ability to run Java applets within web pages, and Java quickly became popular. The Java 1.0 compiler was
        re-written in Java by Arthur van Hoff to comply strictly with the Java 1.0 language specification.</p>
    <h1>Java JVM and bytecode</h1>
    <p>One design goal of Java is portability, which means that programs written for the Java platform must run
        similarly on any combination of hardware and operating system with adequate run time support. This is achieved
        by compiling the Java language code to an intermediate representation called Java bytecode, instead of directly
        to architecture-specific machine code. Java bytecode instructions are analogous to machine code, but they are
        intended to be executed by a virtual machine (VM) written specifically for the host hardware. End-users commonly
        use a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on their device for standalone Java applications or a web browser
        for Java applets.

        Standard libraries provide a generic way to access host-specific features such as graphics, threading, and
        networking.

        The use of universal bytecode makes porting simple. However, the overhead of interpreting bytecode into machine
        instructions made interpreted programs almost always run more slowly than native executables. Just-in-time (JIT)
        compilers that compile byte-codes to machine code during runtime were introduced from an early stage. Java's
        Hotspot compiler is actually two compilers in one; and with GraalVM (included in e.g. Java 11, but removed as of
        Java 16) allowing tiered compilation. Java itself is platform-independent and is adapted to the particular
        platform it is to run on by a Java virtual machine (JVM), which translates the Java bytecode into the platform's
        machine language</p>
