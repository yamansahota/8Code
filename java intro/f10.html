    <h1>What is String Handling and it's Functions ?</h1>
    <p>Strings, which are widely used in Java programming, are a sequence of characters. In the Java programming
        language, strings are objects.

        The Java platform provides the String class to create and manipulate strings.</p>

    <p>The most direct way to create a string is to write: <br><br>

        String greeting = "Hello world!";<br><br>
        In this case, "Hello world!" is a string literal—a series of characters in your code that is enclosed in double
        quotes. Whenever it encounters a string literal in your code, the compiler creates a String object with its
        value—in this case, Hello world!. <br><br>

        As with any other object, you can create String objects by using the new keyword and a constructor. The String
        class has thirteen constructors that allow you to provide the initial value of the string using different
        sources, such as an array of characters: <br><br>

        char[] helloArray = { 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '.' }; <br>
        String helloString = new String(helloArray); <br>
        System.out.println(helloString); <br> <br>
        The last line of this code snippet displays hello.

    </p>
    <h1>Methods of Strings : </h1>
    <p><b>

            1. int length() Method : </b><br><br>
        The length() method of string in Java is used to get the length of the string. In some cases, programs act
        according to the length of the string, and hence this method comes in very handy at that time. <br><br>

        Syntax: <br>

        stringName.length()

    </p>
    <p><b>2. char charAt(int index) Method : </b><br><br>
        The charAt() method of string in Java accepts an index number as an argument and returns the character at the
        given index number. <br>

        The indexing is from 0 to length-1, where length is the length of the string. In case the passed index number is
        not present in the string(if it's equal to or greater than the length of the string or if it is a negative
        number), StringIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown. <br><br>

        Syntax: <br>

        stringName.charAt(index)</p>

    <p><b>3. String concat(String string1) Method : </b><br><br>
        The concat() method of string in Java is used for concatenating two strings. <br><br>

        Syntax:
        <br>
        string.concat(anotherString)
    </p>

    <p><b>4. String substring(int beginIndex, int endIndex[optional]) method : </b><br><br>
        Details: The substring() method in Java returns a specified part of a string. It takes two parameters: the
        starting index (inclusive) and the ending index (exclusive). The substring will include characters starting from
        the beginIndex up to endIndex - 1. <br>

        If we do not provide the endIndex, it is assumed to be the length of the string. <br><br>

        Syntax: <br>

        string.substring(startIdx, endIdx)</p>

    <p><b>5. String equals(String anotherString) method :</b> <br><br>
        The equals() method of string in Java is used to verify if both the strings are equal or not. The equals method
        accepts another string as an argument and then checks for the equality of both the strings. If both the strings
        are equal, true is returned else false is returned. <br><br>

        Syntax: <br>

        string.equals(anotherString)</p>
    <p><b>6. String contains(String substring) Method</b> <br><br>
        The contains() method in Java is used to check if a string contains a specified substring. It returns true if
        the substring is found and false otherwise. <br><br>

        Syntax: <br>

        string.contains(string)</p> 
         <p><b>7. String join() Method :</b> <br><br>
            Details: The join() method of string in Java as the name suggests is used to join a group of strings using the joiner between them. The joiner variable can be any character, string or a sequence of characters. <br><br>
            
            Syntax: <br>
            
            string.join(joiner, str1, str2, str3,..)</p>
