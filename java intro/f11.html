    <h1>What is I/O Stream : </h1>
    <p>An I/O Stream represents an input source or an output destination. A stream can represent many different kinds of
        sources and destinations, including disk files, devices, other programs, and memory arrays.

        Streams support many different kinds of data, including simple bytes, primitive data types, localized
        characters, and objects. Some streams simply pass on data; others manipulate and transform the data in useful
        ways.

        No matter how they work internally, all streams present the same simple model to programs that use them: A
        stream is a sequence of data. A program uses an input stream to read data from a source, one item at a tim</p>
    <h1>Byte Stream : </h1>
    <p>Programs use byte streams to perform input and output of 8-bit bytes. All byte stream classes are descended from
        InputStream and OutputStream.

        There are many byte stream classes. To demonstrate how byte streams work, we'll focus on the file I/O byte
        streams, FileInputStream and FileOutputStream. Other kinds of byte streams are used in much the same way; they
        differ mainly in the way they are constructed.</p>

        <h1>Character Stream : </h1>
        <p>The Java platform stores character values using Unicode conventions. Character stream I/O automatically translates this internal format to and from the local character set. In Western locales, the local character set is usually an 8-bit superset of ASCII.

            For most applications, I/O with character streams is no more complicated than I/O with byte streams. Input and output done with stream classes automatically translates to and from the local character set. A program that uses character streams in place of byte streams automatically adapts to the local character set and is ready for internationalization â€” all without extra effort by the programmer.</p>
            <h1>Buffered Stream : </h1>
            <p>The Java platform implements buffered I/O streams. Buffered input streams read data from a memory area known as a buffer; the native input API is called only when the buffer is empty. Similarly, buffered output streams write data to a buffer, and the native output API is called only when the buffer is full.

                A program can convert an unbuffered stream into a buffered stream using the wrapping idiom we've used several times now, where the unbuffered stream object is passed to the constructor for a buffered stream class. Here's how you might modify the constructor invocations in the CopyCharacters example to use buffered I/O:
                
                There are four buffered stream classes used to wrap unbuffered streams: BufferedInputStream and BufferedOutputStream create buffered byte streams, while BufferedReader and BufferedWriter create buffered character streams.</p>
