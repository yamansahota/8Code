    <h1>What are Packages ?</h1>
    <p>A Java package is a collection of similar types of sub-packages, interfaces, and classes. In Java, there are two
        types of packages: built-in packages and user-defined packages. The package keyword is used in Java to create
        Java packages.

        Many in-built packages are available in Java, including util, lang, awt, javax, swing, net, io, sql, etc. We can
        import all members of a package using packagename.* statement.</p>
    <p>If you had clustered everything inside a single folder, you would probably spend a lot of time finding the correct file. But, separating your files and storing them in the correct folder saves you a lot of time.

        This way, we’re improving accessibility. Accessibility and manageability go kind of hand in hand. Managing a file is related to how easy it’s to modify a specified file to incorporate future needs.</p>

        <h1>Types of Packages in Java : </h1>
        <p><b>1. Built-in / predefined packages</b> <br><br>
       
            When we install Java on a personal computer or laptop, many packages are automatically installed. Each of these packages is unique and capable of handling various tasks. This eliminates the need to build everything from scratch. Here are some examples of built-in packages: <br><br>
            
            java.lang <br>
            java.io <br>
            java.util <br>
            java.applet <br>
            java.awt <br>
            java.net</p>
        <p><b>2. User-defined packages.</b> <br><br>
            User-defined packages are those that developers create to incorporate different needs of applications. In simple terms, User-defined packages are those that the users define. Inside a package, you can have Java files like classes, interfaces, and a package as well (called a sub-package). <br><br>

            Sub-package <br>
            A package defined inside a package is called a sub-package. It’s used to make the structure of the package more generic. It lets users arrange their Java files into their corresponding packages. For example, say, you have a package named cars. You’ve defined supporting Java files inside it.
