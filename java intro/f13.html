    <h1>What is Abstract Classes ? </h1>
    <p>An abstract class is a class that is declared abstract—it may or may not include abstract methods. Abstract
        classes cannot be instantiated, but they can be subclassed.
        Abstract means a small description that gives you an imaginative idea about the concept. Like a summary, a small
        paragraph gives you a brief explanation of the whole book.

        In the same way, Abstract Classes in Java simply declare the methods that are needed to be implemented by the
        class which extends the abstract class. The abstract class hides the internal details of method implementation
        showing only essential information to the user - the method name.

        An abstract method is a method that is declared without an implementation (without braces, and followed by a
        semicolon), like this: <br><br>

        abstract void moveTo(double deltaX, double deltaY); <br><br>
        If a class includes abstract methods, then the class itself must be declared abstract, as in: <br><br>

        public abstract class GraphicObject { <br>
        // declare fields <br>
        // declare nonabstract methods <br>
        abstract void draw(); <br>
        }</p>

    <h1>What are Abstract Methods ?</h1>
    <p>If you use the abstract keyword while declaring the method, it is called an Abstract Method.

        An Abstract Method does not contain anybody. Whenever you declare an abstract method, you must end it with a
        semicolon as shown in the syntax below. An abstract method is always present inside an abstract class, you
        cannot declare it inside the regular (not abstract) class.</p>
    <p>Let's understand some of the rules on the usage of the Abstract Method -</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A method declared with the abstract keyword is called an Abstract method.</li>
        <li>Abstract method can only be declared inside an abstract class or an interface.</li>
        <li>Abstract methods must not contain any definition or body in abstract class.</li>
        <li>You must end the declaration of the abstract method using ';'(semicolon).</li>
        <li>To write the implementation code of these abstract methods, you must inherit the abstract class. Then the
            child class can write the definition for the abstract methods.</li>
        <li>If you don't define the abstract method inside the child class, then you must declare the child class as
            abstract otherwise the compiler will throw an error.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Why Can’t We Create an Object of an Abstract Class?
    </h2>
    <p> If you have read till now, you know we cannot instantiate an
        abstract class. Meaning you cannot create an object of the Abstract class.

        Abstract Class can have abstract methods and abstract method does not contain any body or definition inside it.
        This means that Abstract Class does not seem to be a complete class. It's just a template.

        So imagine, if you create an object of that abstract class and try to access one of the abstract methods, it
        will throw an error because there is nothing inside the method to perform.

        For an object to run any method, it must have somebody and the abstract method does not have any. Hence we
        cannot create the object of an abstract class.</p>
    <h2>Accessing Constructors of Abstract Class :</h2>
    <p>We can declare constructors of abstract classes. The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is responsible to generate a
        default constructor for every class in Java Program if there is no User Defined Constructor present. This same
        applies to Abstract classes as well.

        You can also create a user-defined parameterized constructor for your abstract class as well. Since abstract
        classes are meant to be inherited, the child classes can instantiate the parent class as per its need using the
        super() keyword.</p>

        <h2>Using the final keyword in an Abstract Class</h2>
        <p>
            The final keyword is used when you want to declare a variable, method, or class as non-modifiable once assigned. If your variable is final, you cannot change its value. If you declare a method as final, you cannot override it by inheritance, and if you declare a class as final, you cannot inherit it.</p>
