    <h1>Interfaces and Abstract Classes : </h1>
    <p>In order to achieve Abstraction in Object Oriented Programming in Java, there are 2 ways - Abstract Class and
        Interface. Now here comes the question, What is Interface? <br><br>

        Interfaces, like abstract classes, provide the blueprint of a class. It defines what your class will do, but not
        how it will do it. The interface acts as a way for us to achieve Full Abstraction in Java. The interface is just
        as same as any class. It can have variables and methods but by default, all the methods must be declared as
        abstract.

        It means Interface can only contain abstract methods and not concrete (non-abstract) methods. I know this
        interface seems to be somewhat similar to an abstract class but what makes them different from one another are
        their features. Features like.</p>
    <p>- An Interface can have only abstract methods while abstract classes can have both abstract as well as concrete
        methods. <br>
        - Interface supports multiple inheritance while Abstract Class does not support multiple inheritance.
        An abstract class can implement an interface partially. <br>

        - It can provide the definitions of a few of its abstract methods and leave the rest as it is to be declared by
        the child classes that extend the abstract class.</p>
         <h1>Key Difference Between Abstract Class and Interface in Java</h1>
        <p>Abstract classes can have both abstract and non-abstract methods. Non-abstract methods provide a default implementation that can be used by subclasses. Abstract methods must be implemented by subclasses. Abstract classes can also have variables, both abstract and non-abstract.

            In contrast, Interfaces can only have abstract methods. Interfaces cannot have any variables. Interfaces cannot be instantiated, but they can be implemented by classes.
            
            Abstract classes can be used when you want to provide a base class with some common functionality and implementation that can be reused by subclasses. While Interfaces can be used when you want to define a set of methods that a class must implement, without providing any specific implementation.</p>
