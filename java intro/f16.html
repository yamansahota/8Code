    <h1>What is Exception Handling in Java ? </h1>
    <p>Exception handling in Java is the process of responding to the occurrence of exceptions(Exceptions are unwanted
        conditions that disturb the program execution), it occurred.

        Exceptional handling in Java is a very powerful mechanism as it helps to identify exceptional conditions and
        maintain the flow of the program as expected, by handling/avoiding the errors if occurred. In some cases, it is
        used to make the program user-friendly.</p>

    <p>An exception is an unwanted or unexpected event that occurs during the execution of the program, that disrupts
        the flow of the program.

        For example, if a user is trying to divide an integer by 0 then it is an exception, as it is not possible
        mathematically.

        There are various types of interruptions while executing any program like errors, exceptions, and bugs. These
        interruptions can be due to programming mistakes or due to system issues. Depending on the conditions they can
        be classified as errors and exceptions.

        Java has classes that are used to handle built-in exceptions and provision to create user-defined exceptions.
        First, let's understand the meaning of the exception and error of the term.

    </p>
    <p>Exception handling in java is a mechanism to handle unwanted interruptions like exceptions and continue with the
        normal flow of the program.

        Java uses try-catch blocks and other keywords like finally, throw, and throws to handle exceptions. JVM(Java
        Virtual Machine) by default handles exceptions, when an exception is raised it will halt the execution of the
        program and throw the occurred exception.</p>
    <h2>1. Exception : </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>As mentioned earlier exceptions are unwanted conditions that disrupt the flow of the program.</li>
        <li>Exceptions usually occur due to the code and can be recovered.</li>
        <li>Exceptions can be of both checked(exceptions that are checked by the compiler) and unchecked(exceptions that
            cannot be checked by the compiler) type.</li>
        <li>They can occur at both run time and compile time.</li>
        <li>In Java, exceptions belong to java.lang.Exception class.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Errors :</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>An error is also an unwanted condition but it is caused due to lack of resources and indicates a serious
            problem.</li>
        <li>Errors are irrecoverable, they cannot be handled by the programmers.</li>
        <li>Errors are of unchecked type only.</li>
        <li>They can occur only at run time.</li>
        <li>In java, errors belong to java.lang.error class.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Types of Exceptions Handling in Java : </h1>
    <h2>1. Checked Exceptions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Checked exceptions are those exceptions that are checked at compile time by the compiler.</li>
        <li>The program will not compile if they are not handled.</li>
        <li>These exceptions are child classes of the Exception class.</li>
        <li>OException, ClassNotFoundException, InvocationTargetException, and SQL Exception are a few of the checked exceptions in Java.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Unchecked Exception : </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Unchecked exceptions are those exceptions that are checked at run time by JVM, as the compiler cannot check unchecked exceptions,</li>
        <li>The programs with unchecked exceptions get compiled successfully but they give runtime errors if not handled.</li>
        <li>These are child classes of Runtime Exception Class.</li>
        <li>ArithmeticException, NullPointerException, NumberFormatException, IndexOutOfBoundException are a few of the unchecked exceptions in Java.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>How does a Programmer Handles an Exception?</h1>
    <p>Customized exception handling in java is achieved using five keywords: try, catch, throw, throws, and finally. Here is how these keywords work in short.

        Try block contains the program statements that may raise an exception.
        Catch block catches the raised exception and handles it.
        Throw keyword is used to explicitly throw an exception.
        Throws keyword is used to declare an exception.
        Finally block contains statements that must be executed after the try block.</p>
