    <h1>Primitive Data Types</h1>
    <h2> Byte:</h2>
    <p>The byte data type is an 8-bit signed two's complement integer. It has a minimum value of -128 and a
        maximum value of 127 (inclusive). The byte data type can be useful for saving memory in large arrays, where the
        memory savings actually matters. </p>

    <h2>Short:</h2>
    <p>The short data type is a 16-bit signed two's complement integer. It has a minimum value of -32,768 and a
        maximum value of 32,767 (inclusive). As with byte, the same guidelines apply: you can use a short to save memory
        in large arrays, in situations where the memory savings actually matters. </p>

    <h2>Int: </h2>
    <p>By default, the int data type is a 32-bit signed two's complement integer, which has a minimum value of
        -231 and a maximum value of 231-1. In Java SE 8 and later, you can use the int data type to represent an
        unsigned 32-bit integer, which has a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 232-1. Use the Integer class to
        use int data type as an unsigned integer. Static
        methods like compareUnsigned, divideUnsigned etc have been added to the Integer class to support the arithmetic
        operations for unsigned integers. </p>

    <h2>Long: </h2>
    <p>The long data type is a 64-bit two's complement integer. The signed long has a minimum value of -263 and a
        maximum value of 263-1. In Java SE 8 and later, you can use the long data type to represent an unsigned 64-bit
        long, which has a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 264-1. Use this data type when you need a range of
        values wider than those provided by int. </p>

    <h2>Float:</h2>
    <p> The float data type is a single-precision 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point. Its range of values is beyond
        the scope of this discussion, but is specified in the Floating-Point Types, Formats, and Values section of the
        Java Language Specification. </p>

    <h2>Double:</h2>
    <p>The double data type is a double-precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point. Its range of values is beyond
        the scope of this discussion, but is specified in the Floating-Point Types, Formats, and Values section of the
        Java Language Specification. For decimal values, this data type is generally the default choice. </p>

    <h2>Boolean: </h2>
    <p> The boolean data type has only two possible values: true and false. Use this data type for simple flags
        that track true/false conditions. This data type represents one bit of information, but its "size" isn't
        something that's precisely defined.
        char: The char data type is a single 16-bit Unicode character. It has a minimum value of '\u0000' (or 0) and a
        maximum value of '\uffff' (or 65,535 inclusive). </p>

    <h2>Char:</h2>
    <P>The char data type is a single 16-bit Unicode character. It has a minimum value of '\u0000' (or 0) and a maximum
        value of '\uffff' (or 65,535 inclusive).</P>
