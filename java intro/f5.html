    <h1>Control Structures in Java : </h1>
    <p>Control structures in Java are constructs that allow you to control the flow of program execution based on
        certain conditions or criteria. There are three main types of control structures in Java:</p>

    <h2><b>Selection Statements : </b></h2>
    <P>Selection statements allow you to execute different blocks of code based on specific conditions. The main
        selection statements in Java are: </P>

    <p>1. If-Else : Executes a block of code if a condition is true, and another block if the condition is
        false.The condition is an expression that evaluates to a boolean value (either true or false). If the condition
        is true, the code inside the first block is executed. If the condition is false, the code inside the else block
        is executed.</P>
    <p>2. If-Else-If :In Java, you can use the if-else if statement to handle multiple conditions
        sequentially. This construct allows you to test a series of conditions, and as soon as one of them evaluates to
        true, the associated block of code is executed. Here's the basic syntax of the if-else if statement</p>
    <p>3. Switch: Allows you to execute different blocks of code based on the value of a variable.</p>

    <h2><b>Looping Statements : </b></h2>
    <p>Looping statements allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times as long as a certain condition is met. The
        main looping statements in Java are:</p>

    <p>1. For Loop : In Java, the for loop is used for iterating over a range of values or elements in an array or
        collection. It allows you to execute a block of code repeatedly while controlling the loop initialization,
        condition, and update.<br><br>
        <u>Initialization : </u> This is where you initialize a loop control variable (usually an
        integer) to a starting value. <br><br>
        <u>Condition : </u>It is a boolean expression that is checked before each iteration. If the condition is true,
        the loop
        continues; if it's false, the loop terminates. <br><br>
        <u>Update : </u> This is where you modify the loop control variable after each iteration to eventually make the
        condition
        fals
    </p>

    <p>2. While Loop : In Java, the while loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified
        condition remains true. The loop will continue executing as long as the condition is evaluated as true. Here is
        the basic syntax of the while loop.condition is a boolean expression that is checked before each iteration. If
        the condition is true, the loop continues; if it's false, the loop terminates.</p>

    <p>3. Do-While Loop : In Java, the do-while loop is similar to the while loop but with one key difference: it
        guarantees that the block of code is executed at least once before checking the loop condition. Here's the basic
        syntax of the do-while loop.The block of code is executed first, and then the condition is checked.
        If the condition is true, the loop continues to execute. If it's false, the loop terminates</p>
