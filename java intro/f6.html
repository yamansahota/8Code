    <h1>Operators IN Java : </h1>
    <p>In Java, operators are special symbols or keywords that are used to perform operations on variables and values.
        Java supports a variety of operators, which can be categorized into several groups:</p>

    <h2>Arithmetic Operators : </h2>
    <p>1 . + (addition) <br>
        2 . - (subtraction) <br>
        3 . * (multiplication) <br>
        4 . / (division) <br>
        5 . % (modulus, gives the remainder of a division)</p>

    <h2>Relational Operators:</h2>
    <p>1 . == (equal to) <br>
        2 . != (not equal to) <br>
        3 . < (less than)> (greater than) <br>
            4 . <= (less than or equal to) <br>
                5 . >= (greater than or equal to)</p>

    <h2>Logical Operators:</h2>
    <p>1 . && (logical AND) <br>
        2 . || (logical OR) <br>
        3 . ! (logical NOT)
    </p>

    <h2>Bitwise Operators (operate on individual bits of integers):</h2>
    <p>1 .  & (bitwise AND) <br>
        2 . | (bitwise OR) <br>
        3 . ^ (bitwise XOR) <br>
        4 . ~ (bitwise NOT) <br>
        5 . << (left shift) <br>
         6 .    >> (right shift) <br>
           7 .  >>> (unsigned right shift)
    </p>

    <h2>Assignment Operators:</h2>
    <p>1 . = (assignment) <br>
        2 . = (addition assignment) <br>
        3 . -= (subtraction assignment) <br>
        4 . *= (multiplication assignment) <br>
        5 . /= (division assignment) <br>
        6 . %= (modulus assignment) <br>
        7 . &= (bitwise AND assignment) <br>
        8 . |= (bitwise OR assignment) <br>
        9 . ^= (bitwise XOR assignment) <br>
        10 . <<= (left shift assignment) <br>
           11 .  >>= (right shift assignment) <br>
           12 .  >>>= (unsigned right shift assignment)
    </p>

    <h2>Increment and Decrement Operators:</h2>
    <p>1 . ++ (increment by 1) <br>
        2 . -- (decrement by 1)</p>

    <p>These operators are used in various combinations to perform a wide range of operations in Java, including
        arithmetic calculations, logical evaluations, bitwise manipulations, and more. It's essential to understand how
        these operators work and their precedence rules to write effective and efficient Java code.</p>
