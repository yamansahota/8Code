    <h1>Classes and It's Fundamentals : </h1>
    <p>In Java, a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior of
        objects of that class. Classes are a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming, and they encapsulate
        data and methods (functions) that operate on that data. Here's an overview of how classes work in Java</p>

    <h2>1. Class Declaration : </h2>
    <p>
        - You declare a class using the "class" keyword followed by the class name. The class name should start with an
        uppercase letter, by convention.</p>

    <h2>2. Class Members : </h2>
    <p>- Inside a class, you can define various members, including fields (variables) and methods (functions). These
        members define the attributes and behavior of objects created from the class.</p>

    <h2>3. Object :</h2>
    <p>- To use a class, you create objects (instances) of that class. You do this by using the new keyword to
        instantiate the class.</p>

    <h2>4. Constructors :</h2>
    <p>- Classes can have constructors, which are special methods used to initialize objects. If you don't provide a
        constructor, Java provides a default constructor.</p>

    <h2>5. Access Modifiers :</h2>
    <p>- You can use access modifiers like public, private, and protected to control the visibility of class members.
        For example, you may want to make some members private to encapsulate the class's internal details.</p>

    <h2>6. Inhertitance :</h2>
    <p>- Java supports class inheritance, allowing you to create new classes based on existing classes. This promotes
        code reuse and allows you to create more specialized classes (subclasses) that inherit attributes and methods
        from a base class (superclass).</p>

    <h2>7. Methods and Behavior :</h2>
    <p>- Methods define the behavior of a class. You can call these methods on objects to perform actions or access data
        associated with the object.</p>

    <h2>8. Static Members : </h2>
    <p>- In addition to instance members, you can have static members (fields and methods) that belong to the class
        itself, not to individual objects. These are accessed using the class name.</p>

    <h2>9. Inner Classes : </h2>
    <p>- Java allows you to define classes inside other classes. These are called inner classes, and they are often used
        for organization and encapsulation.</p>

    <p>- Classes are a fundamental building block of Java applications and are essential for creating and organizing
        code in an object-oriented manner.</p>
