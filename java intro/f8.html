    <h1>What is Inhertiance in Java ? </h1>
    <p>A class that is derived from another class is called a subclass (also a derived class, extended class, or child
        class). The class from which the subclass is derived is called a superclass (also a base class or a parent
        class). <br><br>

        Excepting Object, which has no superclass, every class has one and only one direct superclass (single
        inheritance). In the absence of any other explicit superclass, every class is implicitly a subclass of Object.
        <br><br>

        Classes can be derived from classes that are derived from classes that are derived from classes, and so on, and
        ultimately derived from the topmost class, Object. Such a class is said to be descended from all the classes in
        the inheritance chain stretching back to Object.
    </p>
    <p>Inheritance is one of the critical features of OOPs (Object Oriented Programming System), where a new class is
        created from an existing class (parent or base class). In simple terms, the inheritance would mean passing down
        the characteristics of parents(habits, looks, height) to their child.</p>
    <h1>Types of Inhertiance :</h1>
    <p><b>1. Single level Inheritance</b> <br><br>

        As the name suggests, this type of inheritance occurs for only a single class. Only one class is derived from
        the parent class. In this type of inheritance, the properties are derived from a single parent class and not
        more than that. As the properties are derived from only a single base class the reusability of a code is
        facilitated along with the addition of new features.</p>
    <p><b>2. Multi-level Inheritance</b> <br><br>
        The multi-level inheritance includes the involvement of at least two or more than two classes. One class
        inherits the features from a parent class and the newly created sub-class becomes the base class for another new
        class.

        As the name suggests, in the multi-level inheritance the involvement of multiple base classes is there. In the
        multilevel inheritance in java, the inherited features are also from the multiple base classes as the newly
        derived class from the parent class becomes the base class for another newly derived class.</p>

    <p><b>3. Hierarchical Inheritance</b> <br><br>
        The type of inheritance where many subclasses inherit from one single class is known as Hierarchical
        Inheritance.

        Hierarchical Inheritance a combination of more than one type of inheritance.

        It is different from the multilevel inheritance, as the multiple classes are being derived from one superclass.
        These newly derived classes inherit the features, methods, etc, from this one superclass. This process
        facilitates the reusability of a code and dynamic polymorphism (method overriding).</p>
    <p><b>4. Multiple Inheritance</b> <br><br>
        Multiple inheritances is a type of inheritance where a subclass can inherit features from more than one parent
        class. Multiple inheritances should not be confused with multi-level inheritance, in multiple inheritances the
        newly derived class can have more than one superclass. And this newly derived class can inherit the features
        from these superclasses it has inherited from, so there are no restrictions. In java, multiple inheritances can
        be achieved through interfaces.</p>
    <p><b>5. Hybrid Inheritance</b> <br><br>
        Hybrid inheritance is a combination of more than two types of inheritances single and multiple. It can be
        achieved through interfaces only as multiple inheritance is not supported by Java. It is basically the
        combination of simple, multiple, hierarchical inheritances.</p>
